# react-form-components

Smarter drop-in replacements for native form &amp; textarea elements

## Features
- Hitting `Ctrl+Enter` from textarea submits the corresponding form
- When a form component is rendered, the element with `autofocus` attribute (if any, or the first element) is focused by default
